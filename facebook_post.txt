Hey everyone! 👋

I'm actively looking for new opportunities and would love your help spreading the word! 

After 20+ years in engineering across some pretty diverse fields, I'm seeking work in:

🏎️ **Racing Teams** - Currently trackside engineer for Honda in IndyCar (Indy 500 Winner, 2x Manufacturer Championships). Looking for DAG positions, strategy calling, or fly-in trackside work with race teams worldwide.

⚕️ **Medical Field** - Ready to rejoin! I was the first engineer on-site building the Proton Accelerator at OSF Cancer Center in Peoria, leading the complete electrical installation from project initiation through first patient treatment. Interested in medical equipment engineering, project management, or similar roles.

🔥 **Fire & Building Programming** - Experienced in commercial fire alarm programming and interested in building automation systems. Previously worked at GETZ Fire Equipment installing and programming systems for clients ranging from daycares to corporate headquarters like State Farm.

💻 **Remote Work & Side Projects** - Building modern web applications daily using React, Supabase, automation platforms. Open to freelance projects, remote employment, or consulting work.

I'm versatile, code daily on multiple projects, work great as a team leader or solo, and think creatively to solve problems and deliver results.
