## Refined Message Option 1: Personal & Direct

Hey Charles,

Been a while! I've been up in the area a lot lately - Round Lake Beach, think it's about 30 minutes from Siemens.

I'm looking for work up there and potentially moving to the area, so I thought of you. After you trained me at Getz Fire, I went on to work at Varian/Siemens on the proton accelerator in Peoria, IL - built it from the beginning to treating the first patient. I'm currently doing trackside engineering for Honda in IndyCar, but I'm looking for something a bit more grounded where I can "grow up" a little, as they say.

I've attached my resume and updated my website to show what I've been doing: https://pjlosey.com

I'd love to get your thoughts on what might be a good fit for me, especially with your connections at Siemens. Any advice or opportunities you know of would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
PJ

## Refined Message Option 2: More Professional Tone

Hi Charles,

Hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we worked together at Getz Fire.

I'm reaching out because I'm exploring new opportunities in the area - I've been spending time in Round Lake Beach (about 30 minutes from Siemens) and am considering relocating there.

After Getz Fire, I went on to work at Varian/Siemens on the proton accelerator project in Peoria, IL, where I was the first engineer on-site and led the project from initiation through first patient treatment. Currently, I'm a trackside engineer for Honda in IndyCar, but I'm looking for a more stable, long-term position where I can continue to grow professionally.

I've attached my resume and updated my website (https://pjlosey.com) with my current experience and projects.

Given your role at Siemens and our shared history, I'd really value your perspective on what positions or paths might be a good fit for my background. If you have any connections at Siemens or know of opportunities that align with my skills, I'd be grateful for any guidance.

Thanks for your time, and I hope we can reconnect soon!

Best,
PJ Losey

## Refined Message Option 3: Casual but Polished

Hey Charles,

Long time no talk! I've been up in the Round Lake Beach area a lot lately (about 30 minutes from Siemens) and am thinking about relocating there for work.

After you trained me at Getz Fire, I went on to work at Varian/Siemens on the proton accelerator in Peoria - was the first engineer on-site and built it from the ground up to treating the first patient. Currently tuning engines for Honda in IndyCar, but I'm ready for something more stable and grounded.

I've attached my resume and put together a website showing what I've been up to: https://pjlosey.com

I'd love to pick your brain about what might be a good fit for me, especially with your connections at Siemens. What do you think would align well with my background? Any advice or leads would be awesome.

Thanks,
PJ
