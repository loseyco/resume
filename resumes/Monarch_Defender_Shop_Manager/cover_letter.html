        Hiring Team<br>
        Monarch Defender LLC<br>
        253 Commerce Dr.<br>
        Grayslake, IL 60030
    </div>

    <div class="salutation">Dear Hiring Team,</div>

    <p>I'm reaching out because I see a direct connection between the kind of work Monarch Defender does and the world I thrived in at Davidson Racing—where precision, craftsmanship, and leadership all had to operate at the highest level every day.</p>

    <p>At Davidson Racing I managed both the collector-car restoration program and a professional-level prototype racing team. The collection included several high-end exotics—vehicles such as a LaFerrari, McLaren P1, NASCAR Corvette, and more—and I was responsible for their acquisition, restoration coordination, and ongoing care. At the same time, I led the team that built and raced full prototypes from the flat table up. I handled the wiring, logic, and programming, managed crew scheduling and inventory, coordinated vendors, and oversaw fabrication and assembly to professional motorsport standards. Virtually every responsibility in Monarch Defender's job description—shop management, team leadership, project coordination, vendor sourcing, and uncompromising quality control—has already been part of my daily work.</p>

    <p>Beyond restoration and racing, I've also proven my ability to lead complex technical projects. As a Proton Therapy Engineer for Siemens Healthineers / Varian, I supervised more than fifteen electricians and construction partners to help build and commission a multimillion-dollar medical accelerator. Today, as a Trackside Engineer with Honda Racing Corporation, I tune IndyCars in real time using McLaren Atlas, MoTeC i2, and similar systems—work that demands calm precision under pressure and an obsession with detail.</p>

    <p>With my Honda contract concluding, I'm ready to settle near Round Lake Beach and bring these skills home to a shop environment where excellence is personal. Monarch Defender's blend of craftsmanship, modern engineering, and pride in every build is exactly the kind of place I want to invest myself long-term.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I'd love the chance to visit your facility and discuss how my mix of restoration management, racing experience, and technical leadership can strengthen Monarch Defender's team.</p>

    <div class="closing">Sincerely,</div>
