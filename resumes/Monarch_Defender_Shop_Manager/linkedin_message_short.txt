Hello,

I applied to your Shop Manager position on Indeed but wanted to introduce myself here as well. I'm very interested in the opportunity with Monarch Defender in Grayslake.

I managed both the collector-car restoration program and a professional-level prototype racing team at Davidson Racing—handling everything from LaFerrari and McLaren P1 acquisitions to building full prototypes from the flat table up. I coordinated vendors, managed crews, and maintained professional motorsport standards across multi-million dollar projects.

Today, as a Trackside Engineer with Honda Racing Corporation, I tune IndyCars in real time using McLaren Atlas, MoTeC i2, and similar systems—work that demands calm precision under pressure and an obsession with detail.

With my Honda contract concluding, I'm ready to settle near Round Lake Beach and invest long-term in a shop environment where excellence is personal. Monarch Defender's blend of craftsmanship, modern engineering, and pride in every build is exactly what I'm looking for.

I'd love the chance to visit your facility and discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Patrick "PJ" Losey
