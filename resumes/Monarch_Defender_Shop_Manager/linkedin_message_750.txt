Hello,

I applied to your Shop Manager position on Indeed but wanted to introduce myself here as well. I'm very interested in the opportunity with Monarch Defender in Grayslake.

I managed both the collector-car restoration program and a professional-level prototype racing team at Davidson Racing—handling LaFerrari and McLaren P1 acquisitions to building full prototypes from the flat table up. I coordinated vendors, managed crews, and maintained professional motorsport standards.

With my Honda contract concluding, I'm ready to settle near Round Lake Beach and invest long-term. Monarch Defender's blend of craftsmanship, modern engineering, and pride in every build is exactly what I'm looking for.

I'd love to visit your facility and discuss how I can contribute.

Best regards,
Patrick "PJ" Losey
