Hey guys,

I applied on Indeed but wanted to personally reach out. I'm very interested in the Shop Manager position in Grayslake.

I managed both the collector-car restoration program and a professional-level prototype racing team at Davidson Racing—handling everything from LaFerrari and McLaren P1 acquisitions to building full prototypes from the flat table up. I coordinated vendors, managed crews, and maintained professional motorsport standards across multi-million dollar projects.

With my Honda contract concluding, I'm ready to settle near Round Lake Beach and invest long-term in a shop environment where excellence is personal. Monarch Defender's blend of craftsmanship, modern engineering, and pride in every build is exactly what I'm looking for.

I've attached my cover letter with more details. Would love to visit your facility and discuss how I can contribute to your team.

Thanks!
