## Message Option 1: Friendly Reconnect with Update

Hi Ryan,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out and give you an update on my situation.

After we talked last year, I went on to work at Honda as a trackside engineer in IndyCar, which I'm still doing. However, I'm now exploring new opportunities. My contract is up with Honda next month.

I'm interested in exploring opportunities and would really value your help making the right connections. I know you mentioned connecting me with OSF leaders before, and I'd love to explore what might be available, especially in the Monmouth/Galesburg area. I'm open to seeing what leads where and exploring various options.

I've attached my resume and you can check out my website / res: https://pjlosey.com

Thanks for all your help and support - I really appreciated our conversation last year and would appreciate any connections you might be able to share!

Best,
PJ
