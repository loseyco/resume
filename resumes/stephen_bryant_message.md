## Message Option 1: Friendly Reconnect

Hi Stephen,

Hope you're doing well! It's been a while since we worked together on the Proton Accelerator project at Varian. I wanted to reach out because I'm exploring new opportunities and am interested in connecting with people at Varian/Siemens.

Before the Proton Accelerator project, I worked at Getz Fire installing and programming fire panel systems, and I'm currently doing trackside engineering for Honda in IndyCar. I'm particularly interested in building automation, fire systems programming, and other engineering opportunities. I'm also planning to relocate to the Round Lake Beach / Chicago, IL area (close to Siemens facilities).

Im also not appposed to other oppritunities I enjoyed my time with the varian and Siemens and left on good terms.

I'd love to get your thoughts on what might be a good fit, or if you know anyone I should talk to. I've attached my resume and you can check out my website: https://pjlosey.com

Hope you're still enjoying the Miata! Let me know if you ever need any more racing contacts.

Thanks,
PJ

## Message Option 2: More Direct & Professional

Hi Stephen,

I hope this message finds you well. It's been a while since we worked together on the Proton Accelerator project at Varian in Peoria.

I'm reaching out because I'm exploring new engineering opportunities, particularly in building automation and fire systems programming, but I'm open to other roles as well. Before the Proton Accelerator project, I worked at Getz Fire Equipment installing and programming fire panel systems, and I'm currently a trackside engineer for Honda in IndyCar.

I'm planning to relocate to the Round Lake Beach area (close to Siemens facilities) and would value your insights on:
- What positions or paths might be a good fit for my background
- Who I should connect with at Varian/Siemens
- Any opportunities you're aware of

I've attached my resume and you can view my full experience at: https://pjlosey.com

Thanks for your time, and I hope we can reconnect soon!

Best,
PJ Losey

✅ Open to other engineering roles

## Notes

- **Existing Relationship:** You worked together at Varian, so this is a reconnection, not a cold outreach
- **Shared Interest:** Racing/Miatas connection can be mentioned briefly but keep focus on professional
- **Talent Development Role:** Stephen's role in talent development makes him a good person to ask about opportunities
- **Varian/Siemens Connection:** Perfect opportunity to leverage your previous work experience

## Recommended Approach

**Option 2** is probably best - professional but acknowledges the existing relationship. It's respectful of his role in talent development while being direct about what you're looking for.
