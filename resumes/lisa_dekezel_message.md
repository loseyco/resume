## Message Option 1: Short & Professional (Recommended)

Hi Lisa,

Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out briefly - I know you're very busy.

After we met at the Proton Center in Peoria, I went on to work at Honda as a trackside engineer in IndyCar. My contract is up with them next month, and I'm exploring new opportunities.

I really enjoyed my time with Varian/Siemens and left on good terms. I'm interested in exploring what might be available, especially in the Monmouth/Galesburg area with OSF, and would value any insights or connections you might be able to share.

## Notes

- **Previous Relationship:** Met at Proton Center in January 2024, she responded in April 2024
- **Busy Schedule:** As President of hospitals, she's very busy - keep message short
- **Professional Tone:** Respectful, brief, to the point
- **OSF Connection:** She's President of OSF hospitals, so she may have insights or connections
- **No Pressure:** Just exploring and seeing what leads where

## Recommended Approach

**Option 1** is probably best - short but professional, acknowledges her busy schedule, references your previous meeting, and clearly states what you're looking for without being too long.
