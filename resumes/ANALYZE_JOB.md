# Job Posting Analysis & Resume Customization

This document explains how to use the job posting analysis system.

## How It Works

1. **Create a folder for the job** - Each job gets its own folder in `resumes/`
2. **Input the job posting** - Use `JOB_POSTING_TEMPLATE.md` to add the job details
3. **AI analyzes** - I'll analyze the job requirements and match them to your experience
4. **Generate customized resume** - I'll create a tailored resume for that specific role
5. **Review and refine** - We can discuss and adjust as needed

## Folder Structure

```
resumes/
├── CompanyName_PositionTitle/
│   ├── job_posting.md          (Original job posting)
│   ├── analysis.md             (My analysis of requirements)
│   ├── resume.md               (Customized resume)
│   ├── resume.html             (HTML version for PDF)
│   └── notes.md                (Our discussion notes)
├── AnotherCompany_AnotherRole/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a new folder: `resumes/CompanyName_PositionTitle/`
2. Copy `JOB_POSTING_TEMPLATE.md` into that folder
3. Fill in the job posting details
4. Ask me to analyze it and create a customized resume

## Example Workflow

**You:** "I have a job posting for Acme Corp - Senior Software Engineer. Here's the posting..."

**Me:** I'll:
- Analyze the job requirements
- Identify key skills and keywords
- Match your experience to their needs
- Create a customized resume emphasizing relevant aspects
- Generate both Markdown and HTML versions
- Save everything in the job's folder

**Then we can:**
- Review the customized resume together
- Make adjustments based on your preferences
- Discuss any questions or concerns
- Finalize before you apply

## Benefits

- **Organized:** Each job application has its own folder
- **Trackable:** Easy to see which resume went to which company
- **Reusable:** Can reference previous customizations
- **Discussed:** We can talk about each one individually
- **Versioned:** Keep track of different versions if needed
