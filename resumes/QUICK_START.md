# Quick Start Guide

## How to Create a Customized Resume for a Job Posting

### Step 1: Create Job Folder
Create a new folder for the job:
```
resumes/CompanyName_PositionTitle/
```

Example: `resumes/AcmeCorp_SeniorSoftwareEngineer/`

### Step 2: Add Job Posting
1. Copy `JOB_POSTING_TEMPLATE.md` into your new folder
2. Rename it to `job_posting.md`
3. Fill in the job information and paste the full job description

### Step 3: Ask Me to Analyze
Say something like:
- "I have a job posting for [Company] - [Position]. Can you analyze it and create a customized resume?"
- Or paste the job posting directly and I'll create the folder structure

### Step 4: Review & Discuss
I'll create:
- **analysis.md** - Detailed analysis of requirements and matches
- **resume.md** - Customized resume for this role
- **resume.html** - HTML version for PDF generation

We can then discuss and refine the resume together.

### Step 5: Generate PDF
1. Open `resume.html` in your browser
2. Press Ctrl+P (Print)
3. Choose "Save as PDF"
4. Save as `resume.pdf` in the job folder

### Step 6: Apply & Track
- Update `APPLICATION_TRACKER.md` with your application
- Keep notes in the `notes.md` file in the job folder

## Example Conversation

**You:** "I want to apply for a Senior Software Engineer role at TechCorp. Here's the job posting: [paste job description]"

**Me:** I'll:
1. Create `resumes/TechCorp_SeniorSoftwareEngineer/` folder
2. Analyze the job requirements
3. Create `analysis.md` showing how your experience matches
4. Generate `resume.md` and `resume.html` customized for this role
5. Explain the customizations I made

**Then we can:**
- Review the resume together
- Make adjustments
- Discuss any questions
- Finalize before you apply

## What Gets Analyzed

- Preferred qualifications
- Key responsibilities
