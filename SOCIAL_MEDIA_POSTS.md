### Post 3: Story-Driven (Personal)
```
20+ years ago, I started freelancing and never stopped building.

Since then, I've:
✅ Won the Indy 500 with Honda Racing
✅ Built a Proton Accelerator system for my hometown
✅ Managed professional racing teams across IndyCar, IMSA, SRO World Challenge
✅ Led installations for companies from daycares to State Farm headquarters
✅ Coded daily on modern web projects (React, Supabase, Vercel)

Now I'm looking for my next challenge. 

I'm an Electronics Engineer, Coder, and Manager who works just as well solo as I do in teams. I love remote work because it lets me focus on delivering quality solutions without workplace distractions.

Open to full-time, part-time, and contract remote opportunities.

### Post 4: Problem-Solving Angle
```
Thinking outside the box isn't just a phrase for me - it's how I've built my career.

When Honda needed a trackside engineer, I optimized race cars in real-time.

When my hometown needed a Proton Accelerator system, I led the project from start to first patient treatment.

When racing teams needed data analysis and strategy, I built systems that gave them competitive advantages.

Now I'm looking for the next problem to solve.

I'm an Electronics Engineer, Coder, and Manager with 20+ years of experience. I code daily on modern web projects, leverage AI tools to work faster, and deliver results - whether working solo or leading teams.

Available for remote work opportunities.
