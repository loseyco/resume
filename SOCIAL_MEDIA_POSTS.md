### Post 4: Problem-Solving Angle
```
Thinking outside the box isn't just a phrase for me - it's how I've built my career.

When my hometown needed a Proton Accelerator system, I led the project from start to first patient treatment.

When racing teams needed data analysis and strategy, I built systems that gave them competitive advantages.

When businesses needed websites or custom software, I delivered solutions that worked.

Now I'm looking for the next problem to solve.

I'm an Electronics Engineer, Coder, and Manager with 20+ years of experience. I code daily on modern web projects, leverage AI tools to work faster, and deliver results - whether working solo or leading teams.

Available for:
🔹 Remote employment opportunities
🔹 Freelance projects (websites, software, coding)
🔹 Race team data handling & fly-ins
🔹 Business web development & consulting
