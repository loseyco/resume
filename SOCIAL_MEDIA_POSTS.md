### Post 4: Problem-Solving Angle
```
Thinking outside the box isn't just a phrase for me - it's how I've built my career.

When Honda needed a trackside engineer, I optimized race cars in real-time.

When my hometown needed a Proton Accelerator system, I led the project from start to first patient treatment.

When racing teams needed data analysis and strategy, I built systems that gave them competitive advantages.

When businesses needed websites or custom software, I delivered solutions that worked.

Now I'm looking for the next problem to solve.

I'm an Electronics Engineer, Coder, and Manager with 20+ years of experience. I code daily on modern web projects, leverage AI tools to work faster, and deliver results - whether working solo or leading teams.

Available for:
• Remote employment opportunities
• Freelance projects (websites, software, coding)
• Race team data handling & fly-ins
• Business web development & consulting
